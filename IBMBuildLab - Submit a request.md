Submit a DSR (Deal **Support**
Request)
For new requests for  Lab engagement, follow these instructions:
Please NOTE that your ISC Opportunity must be in "Design" or **higher**
stage for Build Lab **engagement.**
You must have an ISC **Opportunity** to request  Lab assistance. We also strongly recommend PTS to formalize the ask before reaching out to  Lab for assistance. Build Lab requests that the IBM seller complete the following initial questionnaire so we can clearly understand the need, use case and scope of the Build project. There is also a partner questionnaire which should be completed by the partner or IBM sales team in lieu of the partner (if you prefer).

Build Lab Seller **Questionnaire**
