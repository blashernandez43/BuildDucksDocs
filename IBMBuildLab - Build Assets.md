# Build Assets

Assets to accelerate success, top assets, and publishing guidance What we create to accelerate Build and Client Success The Build Lab team creates intellectual capital on an everyday basis as we help partners use and embed IBM technologies. These assets have a high propensity for reuse in other partner and even client engagements. To make these intellectual capital assets available to other IBMers, IBM Partners, and the broader community, we **publish** these assets on TechZone and IBM Developer.

Top Assets from Build Lab

## Techzone Embeddable Ai With Watson Libraries

For product launch and partner enablement Build Lab published a collection of assets demonstrating use cases and deployments with Watson NLP and Speech Libraries. Each collection provides a "see it, learn it, do it" experience with demos and reservable environments hosted in TechZone:
- Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
- Topic Modeling
- Entities and Keyword Extraction
- Text Classification
- NLP - Serving Models with Standalone Containers
- NLP - Serving Models with Kubernetes or OpenShift
- NLP - Creating Client Applications
- Watson NLP Hands-on Lab
- Speech to Text
- Text to Speech

## Deploy A Java Microservices Application To Ibm Cloud Code Engine

This collection demonstrates how to deploy a microservices application to IBM Code engine using a **not too simple** and **not to complex** containerized application. A reservation for an IBM Code Engine project can be created to deploy the application in the Americas, EMEA and APAC.

## Open Data For Industries (Odi) Activation Kit

A collection of resources in TechZone that show how to create an installation of ODI, ingest and extract data for ODI, and to setup the ODI Explorer tool. This asset includes a reservation link for an OpenShift cluster in TechZone for IBMers or Partners to easily install and demo ODI with the examples.

## Lab: Cloud Pak For Integration In Action

Workshop-in-a-box based on a sample application that is a simplified version of the IBM Stock Trader demo application. A reservable environment is available in TechZone to provide the OpenShift cluster for Ansible installation of Cloud Pak for Integration.

## Automation For Ibm Watson Deployments

This collection provides a hands-on example of using technologies in TechZone Deployer to create an OpenShift cluster and install Watson Libraries NLP runtime and selectable models, automated with GitOps. Automation can be used to either create a ROKS cluster or use an existing OpenShift cluster created by a TechZone reservation.

## Ibm Developer Kubernetes Operators Patterns And Best Practices

In this article, we introduce a Kubernetes Operator reference implementation that supports an example application deployment and provides support for Day 1 and Day 2 operations. The implementation of the application and Go language operators is published as an open-source project on github.

## Leverage External Data To Enhance Your Chatbot'S Conversational Skills

This tutorial demonstrates how to configure Watson Assistant dialog to get information from an API mediated by a Cloud Function. Using APIs permits access to near real-time data from databases or to fetch public information on the internet.

## Integrate A Git Repo With Your Analytics Project In Ibm Cloud Pak For Data

This tutorial shows you how to get started integrating a GitHub repository with your analytics project in IBM Cloud Pak for Data. You'll learn about the UI, set up a personal access token to collaborate on a project, and step through a hands-on scenario to learn how to push and pull changes to and from a connected repository.

## Use The Watson Nlp Library To Perform Emotion Classification

This tutorial shows how to use the Watson NLP library included in Watson Studio as a Service to of using a pretrained model to classify emotions in tweets by using the watson_nlp library from IBM Watson NLP.

## Spin Up A Single-Node Red Hat Openshift Cluster With One Command

This tutorial uses an Ansible playbook to automate the creation of a small, production-ready, single-node Red Hat OpenShift cluster. This single-node OpenShift instance is one of the smallest production-ready instances of OpenShift that can be Secure routes with passthrough TLS for web applications using Open Liberty on Red Hat OpenShift In this tutorial, you learn how to expose a Red Hat OpenShift application by using a passthrough route with a signed TLS certificate for a custom domain. Specifically, you deploy a web application from a custom container image by using the Open Liberty runtime, and access it externally with a passthrough route.

# Tips For The Build Lab Team

## Publishing Assets

When planning to publish an asset, follow these important tips and guidance to select the destination (if in doubt, review some of the examples listed in this page). The **most important** step in creating an asset that will be reused consistently is understanding the audience, usage and support for the asset. The second most important step is to use the Ecosystem Engineering Asset Guild process to support the lifecycle of your asset.

## What Makes A Good Techzone Asset:

Is the asset something that can be organized into a "see it, learn it, do it" experience that support's IBM experiential sales model? Does the asset require an environment that is used to deploy the content and is there automation to perform all of the deployment steps? Will the asset only be used by IBMers and IBM Business Partners? Will the asset creation team be able to support a range of consumers (e.g. client engineering, technical sellers, business partners) on an ongoing bases as they try to use the asset? If the answer to all four of these questions is YES then this may be a good TechZone asset.

## What Makes A Good Ibm Developer **Asset:**

Is the asset a code example, or detailed step-by-step guide that would be used by a technical (e.g. not sales) user? When using the asset content, would the user be doing this on their own workstation or a personal cloud account (maybe with free-tier service access)? Does the asset provide automation that the end-user is expected to configure and run in their environment? In addition to being technical in nature, is the potential audience for the asset the general community as opposed to only IBMers or IBM Business Partners? If the answer to ANY of these questions is yes, then this asset is probably more suited to IBM Developer.
